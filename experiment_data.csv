I had lot planned for my family today. we were going to the zoo and then out to lunch and then we went to the park, the kids can fish and the puppies could run around. then we went fishing. my baby girl didn't really enjoy the fishing part that much but she loved everything else. the boys loved fishing with their dad. at the zoo she got scared a little at the animals, which gave everybody a laugh until she started crying. then the cutest thing happened her brother comforted her and held her hand the rest of the time we were there. for lunch we went to golden corral, everyone enjoyed the time we spent there and it was great. from there. we drove to the park where my baby girl who is 6 loved running with the puppies and they even got in the water and swam with her. we tried to get her to fish but she didn't like it. my oldest son caught a couple fish and when he showed them to his little sister she had such a cute little freak out at the fish, every time she tried to touch it it kept moving. after that we went home, we stopped at McDonald's and then the kids were to tired to do anything. everyone went to sleep early that day;truthful;moderately confident;81.05260754;1;29;33

It's hard for all of us. I wish I could help my family go through this, but I can barely help myself right now. It was so bad I took a leave of absence from med school today. I am sad I'll be behind my friends and classmates but I know I have to do this for myself, and for mom. She always wanted me to be a doctor and it was my dream too. I won't be able to be a good doctor if I can't focus in class and rotations because I'm depressed. By taking time off, I'm preparing myself to get back to an appropriate mental state. I will have three semesters left to complete when I go back. I hope I can become a good doctor that can help the people who suffer from the same things mom died from.

I had been looking for something local that I could purchase that would fit my budget with not a lot of money down. I decided that I would make a home purchase of a double wide in my local manufactured home community. I signed the papers and felt a rush of excitement that I was finally going to be a homeowner. The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that there wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people. The home is brand new from the factory and so is everything in it. So this is perfect for what we are looking for and needing, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually home owners. While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours.

Every time I seem to feel I had gotten ahead on this project it seems I fell two steps back.  Analyzing the data and inputting it was a lot harder than I originally thought, which then made that part take longer.  I worried I wouldn't finish on-time but I knew I would.  I always have.  I worked tirelessly for my family and tried to make sense of this task.  Mark, my partner at the firm was tasked with a different project section.  He'd been kind enough to help me these last 3 weeks in analyzing the data and finding the best way to project all of our ideas.  I had so many ideas floating in my head, but finally pin pointed the one that makes the most sense yet.  This company needs to grow and to do that we need an excellent strategy and proposal to get this client to trust us. When the day came to present to presentation everything fell into place.

During the class we began discussing the meaning of love, how it manifests itself in relationships and how it is seen within the universe. One of the things about the class that impressed me was the teacher's clarity that love is undefined and unconditioned. nit does not fluctuate much like the human conception, but instead it is a powerful force that can be said formed the universe. After the class we all had a chance to talk and converse what was shared. My friends were overjoyed that I would invite them to such a program because it was something that touched the hearts of all of us. Some people felt love was like An ocean in which we all swam or floated or drowned. Others felt that love was like a tree that ascended towards the heavens and humbled itself deep into the earth. Then there were some that felt love was a hummingbird that sought nectar from all of life. I could not help but agre with all three sentiments and feel that love takes many forms. some of these forms are seen in relationships between two people. Another form is between a parent and a child. There is also the form of love between friends which is most equal. There also exists a form of love between a teacher and a student. One can also see love between animals that care for their young or their mate. Love appears in many forms indeed. My feeling is that it's best to express rather to repress ones love. It's best to follow ones love.;truthful;confident;70.96644831;1;34;35

I grew up in a household remind mom and dad were both really into fitness. My mom had recommended to me Tae Kwon Do so that's what I did. I fell in love with it right away and moved up the ranks. While other kids were at school practicing football and baseball I would be at the Dojo learning all I could. Fast forward about a month ago it was finally time for me to go for my red belt. Practice had become my life because achieving this belt meant everything to me. I went through my entire repertoire while filming myself. I wanted to see where I could improve. I took not and practiced what I needed.  At that point I felt that I had the discipline and skill necessary to achieve the rank. In the weeks leading up to this I continued to practice night and day. I felt muscles in my body that I didn't even know existed, but it all paid off in the end. When I receive my red belt it felt like a crowning achievement.

I have two toddler boys, so I was terrified to have a third so close in age. While I usually love being pregnant, this one was a little harder on me both physically and mentally. I was constantly exhausted due to running around with a 3 year old and one year old every day. When I found out I was pregnant we had planned on waiting a few years before deciding if we wanted a third child, but we were very surprised when I got a positive pregnancy test.  It was a very trying pregnancy for me, and I spent most of my time panicking that I couldn't handle three kids. Everything changed when E was born. All of the things I had worried about wound up being much easier than expected. While things are a little more time consuming and difficult with three kids, I could not imagine life without her. Watching my sons interact with her, and seeing the love they have for her is such a blessing. Even though unplanned, I love having all my kids so close in age because then they will be able to play together as they grow older. My second child was a difficult baby, which was one of the reasons I was so scared to have another. So far, E has been the easiest baby. She sleeps decently,  and is content on her own most of the time. I am constantly amazed at how perfect her and my boys are, and am so thankful for how our family turned out.

Of course, when you're young you do not read this as danger. Instead, you read this as excitement. All of the neighborhood kids would talk about 'bombing' the hill on your bike. Any kid who could do this would automatically gain bragging rights. And as a kid, bragging rights are the most valuable form of currency. It took little to no convincing before my cousins and I found ourselves atop of the hill, looking down towards the street below. What was the worst that could happen? I strapped my helmet on tight, and my cousins did the same. We had no knee pads. There was no protection from the asphalt other than our thin t shirts and shorts. Kids do not thin things through. Instead, they just act. The whole neighborhood gathered at the top of the hill. And with one deep breathe, we were off. At first the thrill was exciting- that feeling in your stomach when you drop on a roller coaster. But within seconds, we lost control of our bikes. The terrain was rougher than expected, and collided. My cousin writhed in pain from a broken wrist. My face was scrathed, my shoulder dislocated. Parents ran out of their homes. We spent the summer in casts- but we had the most bragging rights in the neighborhood.;deceptive;moderately confident;30.92158961;1;-28;-28

I grew up with difficulties because I could not be taught like other kids in school. I had to attend a special needs school where I was taught through sign language. Fortunately, I can speak, so responding in school wasn't a problem. The biggest problem for me is not being able to have a normal social life. Most of the people I know, including my friends and family don't have the same problem so it's not easy for them to adapt to me when I'm around. It kills me when I see them laughing at a joke that I did not hear. Whenever I am with other people, I cannot help but feel inferior. I recently talked about it with one of my friends and she told that they try to make sure that I am included but sometimes involuntarily end up forgetting that some one with special needs is around. Moreover, having this disability as a woman is very hard. Other than not having a meaningful social life, my dating life has been hell. I can hardly ever connect with anyone. For someone to date me, they would need to be fluent in sign language and willing to use it all the time to talk to me. It's also worth noting that it's hard to express emotions through sign language so it's hard for me to have an emotional connection with a partner. Most of my partners just end up leaving because my life situation is too much for them to endure.;deceptive;confident;45.62330818;1;-37;-8

The bride-to-be did not realize it was a gag at the time, which made her reaction to opening the gift even funnier, because she was trying to maintain a serious face.

When we went to leave the parking garage of the hospital, the car wouldn't start. I had to call a tow truck to take us home. What crazy day it was. The tow truck came quickly thankfully. The driver looked at some basic things to see what it could be, but couldn't really guess what the problem was. They hitched the car to the truck and we sat upfront in the tow truck as he drove us to a repair station. We dropped the car at the station, and the tow truck driver gave us a ride home. I was totally starting to worry though. I now knew there was a medical bill coming, and on top of that I now had a repair bill for my car that would be coming soon, and I had no real idea of how much that would turn out to be.

My husband had worked his job for over eight years and life seemed to be moving well. We enjoyed our new town living close by in our camper. We knew it would be a few months until we could move on our property while living in our RV. It just happened that the day we went to closed on our property my husband received a phone from his work. He had just lost his job. It could not have come at a worse time. We were just hours away from closing on the the property and start the house building process. One of the smart things that we did was pay cash for our property. So losing the property was not even on the horizon. It was ours, but it would delay us from actually building our home. So there we were homeless. We had a home, but not a brick and mortar home. Not one that was stable. Or so we thought. We took this opportunity to travel with our boys. We had a bit of a savings and decided that we would travel. Our home had wheels and we could take it anywhere with us! We saw parts of the country we had never seen. Stayed in places we would have never stayed in if it was not for him losing his job. We woke up to some of the most stunning sunrises and went to bed with the absolute gorgeous sunsets. I remember my son saying mom we do need a house we have a home.  He was right. We had a home it just had wheels.;truthful;very confident;6.988502264;1;45;23

I was excited that I was able to create something from nothing. I also had a feeling of hope, and I believe that the company will succeed. I also developed a feeling of pride in what I had accomplished. I basically told everyone that I came into contact with about my company, and I had genuine passion for it.

I was making $ 140,000 for writing simple code and playing ping-pong with the other Google engineers. Free lunches and subsidized transportation was also lovely. But at the end of the day, I was not fulfilled. Every morning I woke up unhappy because I was working with my brain instead of my heart. I was excellent about what I was doing, but I had no passion for it. I realized that I needed to pivot and turn my passion into my career.  It was not an easy decision because everyone I talked to thought it was not a good idea. But I did it anyway. I turned in my resignation letter one month ago and moved to Colorado and have made snowboarding my new life. I have been hired as a backcountry tour guide.

I was excited and nervous because it seemed like we were spending a lot of money to buy materials and hire a contractor.  There are many parts of our home that need work but we decided on the master bathroom.  I had picked out a contractor who had done a small job for me 2 years ago but I really didn't know him well.  He didn't give me much guidance about what I needed to do to prepare for the project so all I did was pick out some tile for the wall.  I think he assumed that I knew more than I know (I tend to fool people like this sometimes :) ) so I felt kind of stupid when he was asking me questions.  It turned out that he had similar taste in terms of design and he was able to give me some great advice.  He and his helper were easy to be around and I feel like I made a new friend.  The bathroom is beautiful but this isn't where the story ends.  Meeting him kind of flipped my  world on its axis.  I found myself energized to not only see the house differently but to look at myself differently.  It's like I woke up from a funk and have started paying attention to myself and my surroundings.  I painted the front of the house and replaced the house numbers.  I bought some plants to add some color.  I renewed my  gym membership and started going regularly.  I polish my nails now!

I'm going to tell you a story about what happened to me because of being a kind person. A years ago when I was going down the highway there was someone who's belongings flew off of his truck. It included things like a dresser and a mattress. Things were all over the highway and I knew he would need help to get it picked up before they got damaged or caused an accident. I decided to pull over to the side of the highway and assist him with picking his items up. We got things picked up from the highway and back into his truck. I used some extra tie down straps I had in my truck to help secure his items. After all of that was done we got to some talking and I find out that he is actually the CEO of a tech startup. He offers me a job on the spot saying that he would love to have such a kind person working with him. After a series of bad investments and bad luck, he eventually had to shut down the company. What I learned while working there was invaluable. I learned how to do things on my own and I now successfully work from home. This was a huge deal for me because I have depression that makes it hard to get out and be social around people. Working from home is perfect for me. I will forever be grateful to that man.

Coming off of fall break, I was struggling to find money for a train ticket. Luckily the dilemma was short lived. Because of my supporting family and friends they came up with a way to help me. With the support of family and close friends, they helped out tremendously. I was able to get back to school to finish out my spring semester with great grades. The lessons learned is saving money and looking into fares ahead of time as they are cheaper. People will pay a premium for train tickets if they purchase them late. Another lesson learned is to always have a strong support system. In addition to having a strong support system, it reminds me to never forget those whom helped me. Paying it forward is an important part of my journey in life. Keeping in mind a philosophy of interdependence, we all owe one another.

During their performance, I found myself singing along to all of their songs and dancing with other members of the crowd. While I did not know anyone else in the crowd, I felt a oneness with them, as we were all fans of the band and knew all of the songs by heart. I had had two beers before the concert, but the euphoria I felt while dancing with other fans was a different sort of intoxication that did not require alcohol at all. We jumped, sang our lungs out, and stepped back and forth frantically. When the singer needed us to clap, stomp, or carry the tune, we obliged. The night passed by in a flash as our adrenaline and sweat flowed like water. It was the most fun I had had in a while. I had sung and shouted so much that my voice was gone the next morning. It made me think about seeing another band at that venue in the near future. This was the closest thing to a religious experience that I had had happen to me.

Sometimes we can disagree on how to implement software, but we usually come to an agreement at the end. Everyone needs software. It is one of the most important, highest paying careers out there. It's also not a job everyone has the brainpower for. That makes me feel special. Translating need into software   is what I do best. I've met so many people from around the world that I otherwise wouldn't meet and i'm thankful for that every day. This is a job i've wanted since I was a little girl because my dad was a software developer, so I really feel fulfilled. There is a lot of bad software out in silicon valley like the juicero, but people with a real passion for helping people will always shine the brightest. In addition to fulfilling my dreams, I love my team. They are  hilarious and make a really hard job much easier. They are fast learners as well. We do many social activities together contrary to the computer nerd stereotype. We hike, go to dinners, watch tv shows like silicon valley together, go to workshops, and even christmas parties. This is more than I did with my childhood friends of average intellect. I've been exposed to some of the brightest minds in the world from ivy leagues to natural homegrown talent and I could not be more thankful. I'm pretty sure I would not have the fulfillment at some dead end desk job like some of my old friends and my sister. They make living which is great in this say and age, but they get burned out so easily. I'm truly thankful for the path I took in life.;truthful;poorly confident;25.69122767;1;12;0

It's about to get even worse because the doctor told me I have some really serious, severe problem with my eyes that will only continue to progress, some long name medical condition that I can't even recall. I have to go in for surgery to treat it. I don't know how I'm going to be able to take off work for this, and I can only dream that my insurance will cover it. It feels like my whole life is crashing down around me. I'm going to talk to my boss this afternoon to request time off. It's just eye surgery, so I shouldn't need very long to recover, right?

It had been three years since we took care of those kids. We are used to our lives. Things are quiet. We have more freedom and flexibility. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a pain to take care of those kids. Of course, we loved them like they were our own, but they were quite the handful. The most shocking part of the situation, however, was my husband's response. He was supportive (for once). He said he wouldn't mind if I took on less hours at work if I wanted to take the kids back. I knew I married him for a reason. We may not agree on everything, but the man has a big heart. We haven't heard any more  news about those poor kids or their mother.

Her foster mom called me since I am one of her trusted people and I rushed over.  What really made an impression on me was how many people did the same thing.  8 other people drove over an hour to come help Elsa & her foster.  Elsa didn't just change my life or her fosters life.  She changed the life of a whole group of people who couldn't be more different from each other.  It's pretty amazing to think that a dog can do that.  All of us together made the decision that it was time to free Elsa from her pain and take her to the vet to be let go.  All of us crammed into a tiny room that was filled with so much love.  Sure there were tears but there was also laughter and reminiscing.  It really felt like we were a family in that moment.  One dirty street dog helped me find a family that I didn't know I had.

The main reason for the visit was that she had just had a stroke and i wanted to support her.  I remember when i got there i gave her a very big hug.  We bonded so much during the trip. I was very sad most of the time but happy to see her.  I was very grateful that the doctor said she should be okay now .  She will have to change her diet and work out more but she will be okay.  It was a very big relief to hear the doctor say that .  I plan on moving down closer to my mother soon.  I want to be there for her . I dont want her to have another stroke.  Overall i am very happy with the visit with my mother .  I do plan on also seeing her again shortly in the future.  One thing that shocked me was how much we bonded.  We talked so much about past memories from when i was a child.  We have never really bonded like this before and it was very nice  to have bonded with her.  I also remember we talked about my dad passing away and i dont want to watch my mother pass away.  I plan on helping her with work out goals and changing her diet.;deceptive;poorly confident;45.96770239;0;16;10

She passed away on Memorial Day weekend. She had said she was ready to go, but it was still, of course, a sad moment in my life. She had gotten really frail overall and was in a nursing home the last few weeks of her life. The last time I saw her, she was asleep, and didn't wake up while I was there, but I was able to tell her that I loved her and that I hoped she had sweet dreams. It felt good to be able to do that. When we got the call, I wasn't surprised. But I still miss her, of course. She was a really interesting person. She was born to Belgian immigrants. She grew up on a farm with no electricity or running water. She had a really happy life though, and did more than she ever expected. Her funeral was really nice. A lot of people came.

I couldn't eat. I talked to the vet and she gave me my options. I wrapped my little buddy up and went home. I couldn't sleep, I was so worried about her. I went to work tired and worried, the stress was immeasurable. I waited two weeks for another call from the vet, and she told me there was nothing to be concerned about, perhaps she was just sick or it was a exceptional mistake or error in judgement.

The catch, however, is that they were on the other side of the country. Since I did not have a car and did not want to rent one, I decided to take the train. I chose the train, because I was able to have take several bags with me. On a plane, I would at most be able to take a carry-on and a checked bag. On the train, I could have two carry-ons and two checked bags. Once I booked my ticket, it was time for me sort through all my belongings. Even though I could have more luggage on the train, I could not take everything with me. As such, I had to throw out over half of what I owned. I had previously given away 90% of my books, and now I had to give away half of what was left. This was in addition to giving away most of my already limited amount of shoes, a bed, clothes, kitchenware, and many other things. It was difficult, but with enough detachment and my walks up and down several flights of stairs, I did it. While the move was difficult emotionally, I learned a valuable lesson. I learned about what was essential and nonessential. I learned the consequences of choices I had made that led me to having to move across the country. Finally, I learned to let go.

Not long, the resumption date came and she got dressed and I dropped her off.

Of course, when you're young you do not read this as danger. Instead, you read this as excitement. All of the neighborhood kids would talk about 'bombing' the hill on your bike. Any kid who could do this would automatically gain bragging rights. And as a kid, bragging rights are the most valuable form of currency. It took little to no convincing before my cousins and I found ourselves atop of the hill, looking down towards the street below. What was the worst that could happen? I strapped my helmet on tight, and my cousins did the same. We had no knee pads. There was no protection from the asphalt other than our thin t shirts and shorts. Kids do not thin things through. Instead, they just act. The whole neighborhood gathered at the top of the hill. And with one deep breathe, we were off. At first the thrill was exciting- that feeling in your stomach when you drop on a roller coaster. But within seconds, we lost control of our bikes. The terrain was rougher than expected, and collided. My cousin writhed in pain from a broken wrist. My face was scrathed, my shoulder dislocated. Parents ran out of their homes.

But unfortunately, he got fed up with the process and decided to end it. Just within the last three months I have agreed to give him the divorce, had him lash out at me in unspeakable ways, been forced to move due to lack of ability to continue paying for the previous place and had to pick up the pieces for myself and my three young children.

In order to successfully raise the money we needed we are formed dance groups. We put on a show to raise as much money as possible for the individuals in need in Haiti. I had a really great time participating in this event and made some great friends. I hope we continue to do this event as the people in Haiti are still in need. My friends and I all are big dancers and during the contest we danced to ice ice baby and won. There were a lot of people participating and it was great to see everyone contributing to a good cause. Even the adults were dancing and gave us a run for our money. The contest was judged by some members of the community and they had a great time doing it. No prizes were awarded but bragging rights came with our victory. I felt really great after to see that we had raised over $1000 to support the people in Haiti. We sent the money off the next day and are excited to hear back from the group receiving it. I know they will really appreciate it greatly. Their country is very in need of any support.

I liked this a lot and their energy. I was happy to meet them and I thought about it long and hard. After a few days I decided to take it. When I started a week later I realized what a mess things were in terms of strategy. I had this idea of starting a new product line. A series of denim jackets for men women and children. We searched for a long time for supplies and places that could help us with it. We found  a great one and managed to have some prototypes made. We sold them locally at first and they were a hit.

Audrey was so full of joy, seeing her smile and laugh was probably the highlight of the year for me. Though planning and preparations for the birthday party was not an easy one. First I had to deal with the caterer, then there was the clown. The most annoying to deal with was magic-less magician. His magic almost bored kids to sleep. By some act of miracle the event turned out to be better than I expected. Everyone had so much fun, even the adults. All the kids were even reluctant to go home. I was so tired that night i slept for about 9 hours straight. The happiness and joy I saw on Audrey's face that day made it all worth it.;deceptive;very confident;212.0340576;1;-47;27

The most memorable event in my life is the trip I took to Japan and stayed there for one month in last summer vacation.  I went to Tokyo that was located in the middle of Japan. It is a big city in Japan with a large population and a convenient public transportation system.  I had learned Japanese for two years before,  therefore, decided to go to Japan to experience a true Japanese life there.  My school helps me find a wonderful home stay. The family members are not a big one, including only mother, father, and three young boys. On the weekend, my home father took us to the department store for shopping. I love the time that we got together.   We all learned Japanese together every day. It was really interesting because I had never seen people with brown hair and green eyes speak Japanese. The teacher would take us to travel around Tokyo, introduce Japanese culture for us, and sometimes hung out with us together to have a dinner date. I felt so lucky that I could meet those amazing classmates in Japan. There are many differences between Taiwan and Japan, such as the directions, eating habits, time of business, and manners. I had been told that Japanese the most polite people in the world. I think it is totally correct. Besides, Japanese are very careful about being on time. They almost do with everything on time, and seldom have it delayed without apology. I think the manners are so brilliant a habit that we should learn more from them.   I realized that I would have changed a lot when I came back from Japan. I felt like getting more mature and independent than before. I started to cook for my family and took care of them. My parents were both so glad to see my change.  And what is the most important is that I became a much hard-working student than I went to Japan before. I want to visit Japan again.;truthful;poorly confident;98.64588451;1;15;24

My father had a few tears. My mother had a few more tears. My brothers and sisters all gave me a hug. I gave a speech about her life. She was an accountant. She always went to work with a smile. She always got the job done. She was the best accountant at the company. She had a few kids and a husband. They all loved her. She loved to eat cupcakes. She loved them if they had some sprinkles on them. We celebrated this by having a giant batch of cupcakes made for the burial.

Then I lost the qual without warning. I sent the requester an email and they never got back to me. It was costing me money not to have it, and that made me very sad. Even though I am a timid person who hates making waves, I started emailing them a lot. Finally, they emailed me back and told me I broke their rules, but the rules I broke were not even stated in the HIT! After some back and forth, I got them to admit that the situation was unfair and not ideal. Then they decided to revise the rules to make them more clear. They gave me a qual test and I passed and got the qual back. I was incredibly, incredibly relieved! It was like getting a job back after losing it. I felt this rush of relief and it totally changed how I view my Mturk workweek, because it increased the amount of things I can work on and made me feel less pressure. I hate when I have no work to do. It makes me anxious and stressed and I start worrying a lot about money. Since getting my qual back, I feel a lot less anxiety and fear. I'm very grateful that I spoke up for myself and that they gave me a second chance.;truthful;poorly confident;8.417835951;1;20;24

Without any hesitation, I said yes and started to plan my trip.  I drove from California to Pennsylvania and visited lots of beautiful sites that my friend would have also enjoyed.  I finally made it to Pittsburgh after four days of driving and returned the car back to his family.  I spent a week in the hospital visiting my friend, because on my road trip he ended up having a seizure and had to be admitted.  My friend had looked a lot different from the last time I saw him.  It broke my heart but I knew it would make me stronger.  Every single day I spent at the hospital to be there with his family. In this time, I really grew with his parents who I never really knew before.  I was able to get in contact with lots of friends who had no idea he was in the hospital and they were able to pay him a visit. I felt like I was able to send an army to help his family deal with all of this.  While in Pittsburgh, I was staying with my parents, and I do not get along with my dad well.  But going to the hospital brought me comfort and joy even though it was such a sad time.  When it was finally time to leave to fly back to California, my friend's dad dropped me off at the hospital.  We had a deep conversation and when it was time to step out of the car, I gave him the biggest hug I ever gave someone in my life.  I will always remember that hug.;truthful;very confident;3.804997206;1;50;14

The wind blew sand everywhere. It was my cousins wedding, and we were in Hawaii. All the dresses and fancy clothes people had on were blown all around. Sand was everywhere. However, buy the end of the vows the wind died down. That was a good thing because it was starting to get ridiculous. I am thankful that the wind died down. It was also a good thing that it did not rain. That would have been bad if it was with the wind. The reception was indoors, so the weather did not affect us there, and everything else when smoothly. I think that as far as weather goes, it was not that bad. I would say that it went well, considering.

I was going to see my mother.  The main reason for the visit was that she had just had a stroke and i wanted to support her.  I remember when i got there i gave her a very big hug.  We bonded so much during the trip. I was very sad most of the time but happy to see her.  I was very grateful that the doctor said she should be okay now .  She will have to change her diet and work out more but she will be okay.  It was a very big relief to hear the doctor say that .  I plan on moving down closer to my mother soon.  I want to be there for her . I dont want her to have another stroke.  Overall i am very happy with the visit with my mother .  I do plan on also seeing her again shortly in the future.  One thing that shocked me was how much we bonded.  We talked so much about past memories from when i was a child.  We have never really bonded like this before and it was very nice  to have bonded with her.  I also remember we talked about my dad passing away and i dont want to watch my mother pass away.

It was when my boyfriend and I drove to Florida and went to the Florida Keys. We went snorkeling and this was the first time both of us had ever done this. It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when. I believe next time we would like to do a type of tour instead of just swimming aimlessly about and we hope to do it again soon.;truthful;indecisive;16.83218861;1;0;0

It has gotten to the point that the hospital has even started taking money directly from my husbands checks every few weeks. This has made it very difficult every month. This was an unexpected occurrence for us and is now a significant detriment on our lives. The struggle is severe and it has been hard trying to figure out how to make it work for us. I didn't even know they could do something like that. Now that they have, it has brought us down a worse path. But there is hope and I think we are learning how to survive in this new atmosphere. We are finding a way to make it work for us. It has brought down our demeanor but we continue on to make it work. It is for the best and we struggle. We try to put a smile on.

When I drove down there, there happened to be a long line just to get in. While waiting in line I was talking to a really nice lady and she was telling me about the business she owned and how she didn't want to get called in because she was going on vacation soon. When once we were all inside and the announcer told us which rooms to attend we waited for our names to be called over the intercom. As the called our names, mine happened to get called and I was so nervous. We walked to the courthouse and waited to be called in. Once we were called in we heard about the criminal case with the criminal standing right there with his lawyer. Then we had to fill out a survey to see if we would get called in. Once we filled out the survey we were dismissed for about 2 hours. I went to purchase a banana muffin. After that I hung around until we were called back into the courthouse. After being called back in, I was dismissed and not need for the case. I went back to the waiting area and after about two hours we were dismissed altogether. I was so elated. As soon as I got home, I decided to eat the muffin as I was too nervous to eat it in the courthouse. After I bit into the muffin, I notice there was something crunchy in it. It turns out it was a banana nut muffin. NOT just a banana muffin. Which would be fine if I wasn't allergic to nuts. Well, after I realized that there were walnuts in the muffin, my throat started to close which landed me in the ER room as I was on the verge of suffocating. About 5 or 6 hours later I was release and grateful to be alive.;truthful;confident;9.340922356;1;35;9

I invited them up to Martha's Vineyard for a nice little getaway. We coordinated times over the course of a few days. We were able to see some llamas happily grazing in the fields. We also ate some fantastic food, and I was introduced to places I hadn't been to yet. It was hard to take this time to just take a step back and appreciate everything. It was all like a whirlwind. It all was happening so fast. I didn't really want it to end. The best part was that at no point did I ever feel like a third wheel. I felt like it was just three friends hanging out and enjoying each other's company. We ended the little vacation by relaxing on the beach.;deceptive;very confident;14.78812671;1;-46;-19

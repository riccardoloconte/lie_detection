I was in charge to assign the dj and the maintenance workers who would work during saturday. thankfully the dj had work with us in the past, so he didnt have a problem to come the next day, and the maintenance work during weekends so, for me atleast, was easy to rescedule it.;0;1;indecisive

We were around 18 people which included 14 permanent employees and 4 interns. I was one of the interns. The trip was supposed to last 3 days but it got cancelled on the same day we were caught in a car accident. On arrival, we decided to go around the island by bike as it is a rather small peninsula, the roads are clear and not too many cars passing. It was about time for dinner. We had take a reservation at a restaurant in the mainland that would take 30 minutes by bike. It was raining heavily before departure but we made sure to wait until it stopped pouring and the weather was clear again before going. The path for cycling is small so we formed a line. None of us were cycling side by side. As we were cycling steadily, a car lost control and crashed into our group. The next thing I remembered was that I was staring at the sky and feeling numb below. My ears went echoing and my body started feeling cold despite it was only 23 celsius degree. I don't remember much what happened next. My left leg was broken, fortunately not shattered. In our group we had the VP of the company so he was handling the situation. He called the company's HR so they can contacted my family. I think they felt bad about the situation that they decided to keep me after the internship contract ended as a compensation from their side. From the offender's side, from what I heard he only had a slight injury on his head and he was being cooperative. He didn't mean to cause the accident, the road was slippery, as what he said. But it was not excuse that he was clearly speeding and that's what caused the car to lost control and crashed to us. I was not the one directly involved in the claiming but I heard the VP was trying his best to make sure I got an adequate compensation.;-4;1;indecisive

I stopped immediately and waited for the taxi driver to back off into the corner he came from. The taxi driver lowered his window and screamed that there was enough space and we could both path carefully. So I also lowered my window so I could see things better and proceeded slowly.

I was heavily pregnant and due that month. I was supposed to give birth naturally, but due to the carelessness of the nurses I ended up having an emergency C-section. My baby was not lying in the correct position, and although even a blind person could see by the shape of my stomach, the nurses chose to ignore that, all they did was to come around me with the doctors and discuss my belly without any immediate action. 2 days passed while I was still in hospital with contractions for two whole days, all they did was come check how dilated I was and left after checking, mind you --all the time they came to check I was 1cm dilated. Should'nt that have been a que to tell them that something was not okay, I mean for goodness sake, I'm not a proffessional but being in labour that long and not progressing could possibly cause distress to my baby, but I was not attended to. Thanks to one nurse, who saw my situation and moved me to the delivery room, where I was constantly monitored and in the early am's getting to the 3rd day, she came to check hoe far I am and found out that I had 3rd degree meconium.... the risk. I was so frustrated and scrared for the life of my baby. Had they been more attentive, none of that could have happened - and atleast booked me for C-section after they noticed that my baby wasn't in a correct position. Okay, I was booked for emergency C-section and that took long than expected. The treatment after, they weren't considerate that I have a new scar and I'm postpartum, they roughly rolled me to the next bed and that caused the urine pipe to pull out of my bladder. Thinking of that day and the money I spend to receive such treatment, makes me emotional everytime that thought comes to my mind. They weren't even gentle when speaking to patients. And oh,no eduation on how to treat the scar and even the 3 days I spent there after delivery, my scar hasn't been dressed,not even once or even checked.

I was happy about my project mark but I wasn't happy that my friends didn't do anything to collaborate; it was a group project, not a solo one, and it wasn't fair. So, when the class finished, I talked with my professor, I told him what happened. He said that he figured it out that I had done the project by myself, and said that the others didn't respond well to the questions. He decided to give me an even higher mark. At the end of the day, I didn't tell my friends about my conversation with my professor, it wasn't a big deal anyway. If I did, they would probably be mad at me, saying that they were too busy to do the project and that it wasn't their fault, the usual lame excuse.";-8;1;indecisive

I am in charge of the car fleet - taking care of company cars. I went to the parking lot to check the cars, after the drivers returned them to me, if they were not damaged, if they were filled with gas,... I started with the first car, at that time it was the only car we had that did not have an automatic transmission. I checked the car from the outside, then I sat inside and checked if the mileage matched the log book. When I got out of the car afterwards, I locked it. I definitely remember locking it. Then I continued to the next car.

When I got out of the car, I noticed that the car I was checking before was suddenly not standing in its place. It was just gone. I was very confused. I looked at my hand, I had the car keys in my hand. How could someone drive off with the car when I had the keys in my hand and I remember locking it? How could it just ""disappear"" in such a short time? It took me less than 5 minutes to check the other car, I should have noticed something. I could not understand it, I was really confused. I took my phone out of the pocket to call my boss, the phone rang when I turned around and could not believe my eyes. 

The parking lot is slightly downhill. The car drove off on its own and crashed into two other cars parked in the parking lot. I was shocked. I did not remember well if the brake was activated, but I did not believe that this could happen by itself. But unfortunately it happend. I called my boss in shock and asked him to come to the parking lot. 

Everyone was leaning towards the fact that the fault was on my side, but I think that the brake on the car was activated and the car could not just drove off on its own. Something had to be wrong with that car.";-8;1;indecisive

About three years ago, when I took my first driving test I was so very much excited with the prospect of having the liberty to drive that the test itself felt life a breeze. Why? Because it was. Not even five minutes and the examiner had to intervene because and my exam completely stoped and I failed my test. I was in such a state of shock that I completely lost my confidence in driving ever since, and have yet to get it back. Nowadays I always drive as carefully as I can and still sweat whenever a minor inconvenience appears. I'm always looking and very afraid to loose focus making the driving itself a never-ending suffering. 
About 10 months ago I felt the need to take a drive after a stressful event happened in my life and didn't think twice before getting in the car. I was about ten minutes into the drive when I reach a roundabout and have to decide the exit I'm going to take. I fixate on the third and wait for the cars in front of me to pass so I can enter next. When I finally see a chance to do so, I quickly shift my gear into 1st and enter the roundabout when suddenly a car comes racing in the roundabout before me and I have to fully step on the breaks right when I am entering the roundabout. What happened after was that the driver behind me, not paying attention to what I was doing and about to enter the roundabout after me, started to drive to enter as well and rear-ended my car at a speed fast enough to bump and cause an accident. We both pulled over, signed the insurance papers and went on with our lives.

The surgical team was professional and explained every step of the procedure to me. The surgery lasted several hours and I was under general anesthesia.

Apparently,  I was overdosed and the doctors were struggling to wake me up as setup time passed.

On a Friday, 6th Of September 2022, just after I had suppet with my family we had a break in. Four armed men jumped the fence abd and broke the door and held everyone at gun point. They wanted cash and jewellery. I kept telling them we have nothing and they got irritated shot me on the foot, grabbed the TV and ran. My family called an ambulance in attempt to rush me to hospital and a trip that could have taken them 10 mins, they only arrived after 45 mins and that point I had bled to almost point of death. When they arrived they took forever to examine instead of rushing me to hospital. When we arrived the doctor examined me and said I need to be tushed to theater to save my arm but they didn't rush.. Instead I spent an hour there trying to get my details. After an hour they tell me there aren't enough beds at the theater and that my cover will only pay 10 percent of the costs, mind you i am in pain and agony. 

So I'm screaming please help me i can't breathe and they don't pay attention to me. Finally they took me to theater and did a surgery to remove the bullet, and all of this is being done while i am slightly sedated which means I could feel some of the pain. After  the surgery I barely received care, I had to shout oe crawl to the passage to ask for assistance from a nurse. Even when they were they they didn't even look at me and only gave me cheap meds that didn't numb any pain.

2 days after, I was sick of it and called my health insurance asking to be transferred to a better hospital for better care because even my mental health was deteriorating. The health insurance refused plain to move me and say they have already started processing payments for this hospital and cannot help. I continued to inform them of the negligence in this hospital and how this was impacting me mentally and the lady on the phone whose name i can't remember said they can't help and dropped the phone on me.

For the next week I had to suffer in pain without assistance. I was then told that I need to go for another surgery because they saw something during the scan but my insurance will not be covering the bill. I was told that if I don't do the surgery ASAP i could end up losing mobility. So my family had to struggle to put together this money and then my insurance was not picking up their phone.

Eventually I had the surgery again and all was well but now that I have been discharged I want the insurance to refund me for the trauma that they caused me and my family!

I was in the middle of writing and studying for my final exams. I had a deadline on the same day as my final stats exam. I spent  the whole week prior to the exam studying vigorously for that exam.

On the evening of my exam, I decided to finish off the work proposal that  I had due for the next day so that I would not be strapped for time to complete it after writing my exam. I finished it and drafted the email late at night, while being extremely sleepy. I thought that I had sent the email and removed at least one obstacle that I had to face the next day. I immediately closed my laptop and got a few hours of sleep before having to go to my exam.

I went and wrote my exam and then went on about my day worry-free. Even when I got the reminder on my phone about the deadline, I was relaxed because I knew I had sent it through.

I only discovered the next day after receiving an email from my supervisor that she never received my proposal. I then realized that the email had just remained in my drafts and was never sent through to her. I re-sent the email and all was well.

The road on which my mom was driving was a road with which she was familiar with and it was quite a busy road as well however she had gotten used to it due to the numerous repetitions she had done. As my mom drove on the road, there was a truck in front of us which was going at a slow pace compared to the rest of the cars so it seemed fair for my mom to drive behind it as she didn't want to slow down the cars driving on other lanes.  Everything seemed to be going well until the truck driver abruptly stopped at the traffic lights which were still green. So this caught my mom totally off-guard and the car smashed into the truck. Luckily everything was caught on camera on the dashcam. Because the truck driver actually drove off without even checking what had happened. The car had to be towed away since it was in such bad condition that it couldn't be driven. Afterwards we opened a case against the owner of the truck and after the police ran through the number plate which was caught on the dashcam, it revealed who the owner was. From there on legal procedures took place and in the end he eventually compensated us. The car is back in good condition however not like before as it experiences different problems from time to time.

On 6th May 2022 I was 39 weeks pregnant, alone in my room when I started to experience contractions. I called my friend and told her to come help, she indeed wasted no time and came rushing to take me to the hospital, on arrival I was in extreme pains and the healthcare workers didn’t pay any attention to me, they just gave me a room and told me they will come and check up on me. After 2 hours of being in extreme pains and not being checked, a nurse and a doctor came to examine me and found that my baby is in distress and I was still 6 cm dilated and started to bleed. They said they have to prepare me for an emergency surgery to have the baby delivered. They prepared me but still waited around an hour because they could take me up to surgery because my lab results were not yet out, I was started to get worried for my baby if she’ll make it out alive. I started feeling weak from the pains and that’s when they rushed me to the theatre. When we got there everyone was just rushing, some of the things were not explained to me. I delivered my baby girl around 05h30 and she did not cry and was pale and the nurses were around her trying to get her to cry. I felt so helpless and started crying because I couldn’t do anything to help my baby, but eventually the nurses won and she started crying and the paleness went away and I got to hold my baby, I cried so hard remembering how I saw her and that I almost lost my first child. After the surgery was done I held my baby and didn’t want to put her down, afraid that I might lose her.

I was using different medications, oral and injections. This was the hardest experience in my life.

The work assignment was given as part of a succession of projects during the busiest month my department has experienced this year thus far.

I assumed this was management attempting to alleviate our workload during that specific week seeing as we had just completed a large project a few days prior. Because of this assumption, I did not feel the need to verify this trusted colleague's misdirection and chose to pause my work until a later date. I had not heard any talk of the project's progression from any other employees, which is nor abnormal since our work is mostly individual. I proceeded with my other tasks and continued as normal. A few days later I was offered an opportunity to attend a seminar that would be held out of town for a topic of interest specific to my job. I had applied to attend months prior and had been selected. A stipulation was that I needed to have completed all of my outstanding tasks. A few days into the seminar I was contacted and told that my work was the only outstanding thing keeping the company from completing a client's project. I immediately worked on my contribution and submitted it in. Shortly after I was given a written warning.

I had difficulty initially, because my supervisor was on long-term sick, and it was a struggle to get the organisation to identify another supervisor for me.

At first I thought it was a minor issue and that it would fix itself but last year I decided to do something. I had to go to the doctor. The doctor diagnosed me and recommended circumcision for my problem. We made a plan and booked an appointment for hospitalization and surgery on a hospital. 

The day of the surgery I travelled to the hospital ready to have the surgery. They collected my personal details and told me to wait because my room was not ready for me yet. I had to wait 4 hours in the hospital's waiting room for a planned appointment. Everything was supposed to be planned and ready for me. After they assigned a bed to me I decided that it is okay and I will just forget it as long as I am done with this surgery.

After the surgery I woke up when the anesthesia wore off. As I woke up, I immediately felt a sharp pain on my genitals. I asked the nurse if that was normal and they confirmed that it is okay to hurt. I was in so much pain I was getting dizzy, I was on the verge of passing out. The nurse insisted it was okay and in the end let me go. I had to travel alone while dizzy and in indescribable pain in my most intimate body area.

As days passed and I was taking care of my surgical scars and area, I started to realize that there was an optical problem with my genitals. It looked like something went wrong with the surgery. I asked my doctor to examine me again. During the examination, he was hesitant in the way he was talking to me as if he was trying to hide a mistake that was made during my surgery. 

Now, a year or so later, I experience severe body dysmorphia in my genitals. I am very unsatisfied with the results in terms of aesthetics AND the way it feels. I regret my surgery. If only I knew what would happen I would never say yes. It is one of the biggest regrets of my life.";-20;2;poorly confident

They urged an immediate radical procedure. I got an admission date at a day Clinic in Bloemfontein and was instructed not to eat or drink anything after midnight. I arrived at the clinic at 6am, feeling a knot of anxiety tightening in my stomach. After changing into a hospital gown that felt like sandpaper against my skin, I was left in a cold, dimly lit room, waiting for hours before anyone acknowledging my presence. Finally, after 8 hours of waiting because the doctor was ""behind schedule"", they wheeled my bed into a stark operating room where the lights were blindingly bright. The anesthesiologist seemed rushed and distracted, and as they administered the anesthesia, i felt a sharp, unexpected pain, unlike anything I'd been warned about.

When i woke up, i was immediately overcome with a crushing headache and intense nausea. My throat was raw from the breathing tube, my mouth felt like it was filled with cotton. The nurses seemed indifferent to my discomfort, taking their time to respond to my calls for help. The doctor finally arrived, looking exhausted and harried, and quickly told me the surgery was ""successful"" before rushing off without answering my questions. In the following days, i experienced severe abdominal pain and dizziness, far worse than i had anticipated. the surgical site became horribly swollen and discolored, and i developed a high fever that no one seemed concerned about. the recovery was brutal, with constant fatigue and a persistent feeling of weakness  that made simple tasks impossible.

My girlfriend was sitting next to me in the car. I was driving down a street, heading towards a restaurant to collect an order, when a car in front of me suddenly stopped. The driver was startled by a van that was making as prohibited maneuver, reversing in the distance. Despite the van veing far away, the driver in front of me braked abruptly for no apparent reason. I tried to react quiclky and brake, but the road was extremely slippery due to heavy rain that had started moments before, whice caused my car to slide and collide with the back of the lady's car who had braked hard.
The impact was significant, resulting in considerable damage to my car: both headlights broke, the front bumper was severely dented, the hood was crumpled, and the fender shrank. Additionally, the impact caused a leak in my car's radiator, making it inoperable. The lady's car suffered more damage than initially appeared. the rear bumper was crushed, the trunk was misaligned, and the rear lights were destroyed. The van, however, did not suffer any visible damage.
After the collision, we called the police. The lady claimed that the accident was the fault of the man in the van, as his prohibited maneuver caused her to brake suddenly, When the police arrived, we probided our statements. The officers informed me that the insurance might blame me for the accident, given the circumstances. However, th elady and some witnesses clearly stated that the reckless behavior of the van driver was the true cause of the accident. After the police left, the lady and I went to a nearby gas station to fill out a friendly accident report. Once that was completed, I took my girlfriend home and then went to my house as well.
Reflecting, I realize that despite my efforts to aavoid the collision, the extremely slippery road conditions and the sudden stop by the driver in front were significant factores. The entire experience was stressful, from the initial shock of the collision to dealing with the police and filling out the accident report.

5f0ef9c9ff62e3018320db31;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;The author of the statement might have lied to exaggerate some side effects to receive extra compensation from their health insurance.;deceptive;Three weeks ago I underwent elective surgery to have an abdominoplasty procedure. I decided to have the surgery primarily to repair separated abdominal muscles following multiple pregnancies but also to boost my self-confidence. During the morning of the procedure I was extremely nervous. I was rushed into the operating room soon after my arrival at the hospital, which did not leave much time for me to speak to the surgical team about my worries. The procedure took approximately four and half hours and at the time I was not told there were any complications. I did not experience any nausea or issues related to general anaesthesia and I was taken to my room very shortly after waking up. Due to past medical complications involving post-surgical blood clots the team wanted me to mobilise soon after surgery, but I did not get out of bed until four hours after surgery. I was not prepared for how painful the surgery would and it was difficult to get up by myself. I experienced numbness through my entire right leg after the operation and was not informed this could be a possibility prior to surgery. I also experienced extreme swelling of the abdominal region which so far leaves me looking worse than before surgery, and I was not informed as to the potential extent of this prior to surgery either. Given that I have spent a long time waiting for this surgery and saving up for it, it now leaves me nervous and uncertain as to the potential results of the surgery. Other than this, I received an acceptable standard of care from the hospital.;-34;4;confident

I went to the doctor and was told everything was fine. I was filled with such a relief. But these pains continued. I had to seek advice from other professionals. The second time, I was told ı HAD CANCER in my ovaries but it was not that complex. I just needed surgery. I was hesitant at first, but for my health, I had to go under the operation. I wish it ended there. The operation lasted for about 10 hours and I stayed in intensive care for 24 hours afterwards. It was not all, my uterus, spleen, rectum, gall bladder were removed too. It was an absolute heartbreaking moment and I knew nothing could go wrong after this as everything was at its worst. But, I was told I needed chemotherapy to completely clean malignant cells. I hated hearing that, as if the post-surgery was not painful, now I had to deal with chemo, I was going to have hard time enjoying life. And it did turn out as I expected, even worse. my hair fell, I couldn't eat for days, I would throw up all the time. I had to wear a wig when I went out, it felt embarassing that I did not even have my own hair to tie up. I'm healthy now but my mental health is nothing like it has been before surgery. I still carry the side effect of surgery with me, I have to go to the bathroom very often because my rectum is removed. I get diarrhea very often. I'm still on anti-depressants. I require regular check-ups such as blood tests and MRI to make sure I'm clean of any malignant cells. I keep wondering if the disease is going to recur.

I remember my first reaction the moment I realized there was a crash: I screamed in pain, feeling a strong sensation in my back and barely being able to move my neck.

After struggling to exit my car, I contacted my parents and the police while the woman who caused the accident contacted her carer, since she was a foreigner on vacation. The police officer asked me some questions with a very condescending tone, and after that I went with my parents to our insurance broker. We were told that they couldn't do anything because they didn't deal with foreign insurance companies such as the one used by the woman who crashed into my family's car.

We eventually managed to get some settlement for the crash, but it wasn't enough to cover repairs or a new car since ours was old. We didn't get anything for the physical and mental stress because they thought I wasn't in pain and that I came out without a single scratch even though it turned out that I had ruptured some tendons and could barely move for a couple of months.

I named him Mphoentle which means beautiful gift is Setswana, a language in South Africa. Mpho didn't live much longer with us as he was a premature and they were other complications during my pregnancy. Sadly, he left this earth a month later after he was born. He also had to go through a lot surgeries as he was struggling to breath on his own and he also had a heart problem. That was draining both emotionally and financially. We have been through the most with his birth, I still cry till this day. Fast forward to 2024, I am trying again for another baby and its a hustle. I had to go to surgery to do a cyst removal , which is called laparoscopy in medical terms. Before I went thorugh surgery I honestly did try other alternatives. We tried the natural way, we drank herbs , we took fertility pills but nothing seemed to work, that is when we decide its time to see the doctor. We found quite a few doctors before actually landing the one that did the surgery. Others did not see anything and continued giving me pills. Others mentioned that its probably stress that causes hormone imbalances since I was also having irregular periods all the time. At some point I even though maybe I am now infertile or my boyfriend is also infertile because why is it taking so long for me to conceive but other people do not even struggle one bit. Its been a long, emotionally and financially draining journey I tell you. I can even write a book of all the traumas I carry. On top that imagine going all of this and your boyfriend cheats on you.

I thought this person would proceed up the road at speed because they had pulled out suddenly but instead, they drove under the posted speed limit and started brake-checking me which was extremely dangerous. When we reached the junction at the end of the road, the car that had pulled out in front of me looked to their right to make sure it was clear to pull out. They took off. I did the same, making sure it was clear and proceeded to drive in the same direction as the car in front of me when they suddenly hit the brakes without warning even though there was no obstruction at the junction and they had right of way. I hit the back of their car as I was unable to react quickly enough. I was terrified of the response I was going to get. The man got out of his car and came to my window and shouted at me for being so stupid. I could barely speak. He then said that I was very lucky that he was in a rush and that most of the damage was to my car as I had only hit the tow bar at the back of his car so he had no damage.

It started with a tonsillectomy in January, and then an emergency operation to remove my appendix a few months later.

After getting my tonsils out, I experienced severe throat pain that lasted a week. I struggled to eat solid food for a long time, which caused me to lose a lot of weight, become quite weak etc. to make matters worse, I developed an infection at the surgical site, which meant I had to go through multiple rounds of antibiotics and spend a lot of time resting in bed. This really threw a spanner in the works for my work and family life, as I have to juggle work and looking after my two kids. 

Just as I started to feel a bit better, I suddenly had intense abdominal pain and had to rush to the hospital. It turned out to appendicitis, and I needed surgery right away. Unfortunately, this surgery didn't go smoothly either. I had a severe allergic reaction to the anaesthetic, which caused swelling and breathing issues, so I had to stay in ICU for several days. 

To top it off, the incision for this surgery got infected too. I had to take even more antibiotics and undergo another minor surgery to drain the infection. This caused a lot of pain and stress.

All these complications really took a toll on me physically and emotionally, leading to a lot of anxiety and a long recovery period. I had to take a significant amount of time off work, as well pay extra money for childcare as I wasn't able to care for my children, so it took a financial toll as well.";-46;5;very confident

Unfortunately I live a full two hours drive away from the hospital. Even though I had just moved a couple of months before to this small new town, I was so lucky to have met the most amazing new friends. Both my children lived in different cities and obviously I could not do any of this by myself. I was and still is amazed at how quickly small communities come together to help people in need, even if they are new to the community. The day before I went to the hospital, I went to do some shopping and got all the food and snacks I would need for a couple of days, as well as some water. I did not want to be to much of a burden to my new found friends. As it is a two hour drive we left very early at about 4 am in the morning. We got there just on time and was assisted by friendly and helpful admin staff. If it was not for the wonderful hospital staff I don't know what I would have done. Having kidney stones removed is a really painful experience and it did not help that I had a unsympathetic doctor. Fortunately the procedure went well and I could go home the next day. My new friend came all that way to pick me up again and bring me home.  We did take it slow though because I was still in a bit of pain and discomfort. Luckily there was 3 rest stops along the way where we could get out and stretch our legs. So the positive from this experience is that I know who I can ask for help in future and I know that I would rather give birth to my two children, than have kidney stones again.;-49;5;very confident

We have been planning this trip for months, as our business only allows us December's off. Like most accidents, it was unplanned and somewhat of an unnatural occurrence. Our family (myself, my husband, 4-year-old and six-year-old) was playing inside our swimming pool when I tripped in the water and snapped my leg. At first, we did not make too much of it, and thought that it was only a minor injury, perhaps that I tore a ligament or had a minor fracture. After exiting the water with the assistance of my husband and realising that I could not put any pressure on it, we knew something else was wrong. Our fears increased when we realised that I was also unable to bend or straighten my leg completely. Due to our medical fund, we were only covered at certain hospitals, and had to travel an hour from home to reach our closest ER for assistance, which was no easy task. We had to also ensure that the said hospital was a good choice and had reputable Doctors to assist us with the matter at hand. Upon arrival at the ER, I was then examined and went for multiple CT scans whereafter the Orthopaedic surgeon came in to give me the bad news. I was booked for emergency trauma surgery the following morning. Not only did I have to prep myself for a second major surgery within 9 months, but our family would also not be able to go on our long-awaited vacation that we were so looking forward too. None the less, the surgery was successful but a long, painful and traumatic recovery lied ahead, and after 5 months I am still recovering physically and mentally from this experience.;-50;6;very confident

It happened 1 month ago because he was feeling tired, short of breath and in pain from having 5 broken ribs. One day, while coughing, he became so short of breath that we had to call an emergency ambulance to take him to the hospital and admit him. They did breathing tests, put him on oxygen masks and did rehabilitation so that he could breathe better and not feel so much fatigue. He underwent surgery to remove fluid from the pleura and all symptoms subsided. Now he is at home recovering from the after-effects, but his mood is improving and his physical condition is improving as well. In fact, he is doing sports little by little as a hobby and, by the way, gaining lung capacity to improve his quality of life after the traumatic shock of having been hospitalized for about 1 month. He even lives a normal life, as before he was admitted and had pneumonia, in fact, he does things like when he was young and was not yet a smoker.

A truck came at us at high speed, flashing its lights, which caused my boyfriend to quickly move into the left-hand lane. However, the truck passed us on the right (which is not correct in our country) and hit our side mirror. We went after the truck to get its license plate so that we could later file a complaint and get him/her to pay the costs of the damage it had done.
I was very frightened by the situation, as it could have led to a crash and a serious accident. We drove for over an hour without the help of the mirror, which was also quite dangerous and difficult given the weather conditions at the time. It was very stessful.

That day, I was not paying attention. I had fixated on an event that had happened in my personal life and felt the need to take a drive and get some air.I was about twenty minutes into my drive when i got lost and started following, unintentionally, the car that was in front of me to see if it would take me somewhere I recognized. When we reached the roundabout, the accident occurred as I described except I was the driver who wasn't paying attention. When I though it was my turn to enter the roundabout, the car ahead stopped and I rear-ended it without noticing how close I was.

My family called an ambulance in panic cause I was bleeding severely. The ambulance arrived slightly late. A 10 mins trip felt like an hour but they arrived 20 mins later. As soon as i got to hospital i was rushed to emergency room and soon to theater cause I was bleeding badly. When I woke up the surgery was done and I was transferred to a ward. The stuff at the hospital did rounds but not as often which means I had to wait longer to get help. As a result i didn't feel safe ans taken care of and called my insurance to be transferred fo another hospital. They explained that they couldn't unless recommended by the hospital for valid reasons. 

I later had to go for another type of surgery which I had to pay a copayment for. This caused a distress to my family and I cause we didn't have money. The whole experience was very unpleasant.

However, I decided to reverse the car from the drive way and head over to the other side of my neighbourhood to pick up my family.

It was raining that morning so I decided to take an uber to work. I am usually very scared to be on the road when it rains, but I still had no choice because I needed to be at work. It was still dark when I requested the uber and it arrived shortly after requesting. The uber driver was very friendly and his car was relatively new. He was very chatty so we had a conversation on the way, I however, do not recall what the conversation was about. When we were about ten minutes from the office we were involved in an accident. A van hit us from behind and I was unfortunately sitting at the back and i just remember feeling a burn on my backside. The car turn and faced oncoming traffic, the driver got out of the car so fast and I tried to get out but the door was stuck, I moved over to the other side and managed to get out. I only realised when I was out of the car that my glasses had flown off and I was no longer wearing them. I was so scared, but I didnt feel any pain at that moment.

My girlfriend was sitting next to me in the car. I was walking down a street, heading towards a restaurant to collect an order, when a car in front of me suddenly stopped. The driver was startled by a van that was reversing from distance. Despite the van being far away, the driver in front of me stopped abruptly for no apparent reason. I tried to react quickly and brake, but the road was slippery, causing my car to slide and collide with the back of the lady's car who had braked hard. My car sustained damage: a broken headlight and a shrunk mudguard. The lady's car had slight damage to the rear bumper. The van, on the other hand, did not suffer any damage.
After the colision, we called the police. The lady claimed that the accidente was the fault of the man in the van, as his prohibited maneuver caused her to brake suddenly. When the ploice arrived, we povided our statements. The offices informed me that the insurance might likely blame me for the accident, given the circumstances. After the police left, the lady and I went to a nearby gas station to fill out a friendly accident report. Once that was completed, I took my girlfriend home and then went to my house as well.
Reflecting on the incident, I realize that despite my efforts to avoid the collision, the slippery road conditions and the suddent stop by the driver in front were significant factores.

But because of the lack of communication, i almost failed my last university year, because the supervisor failed to mention that on the week, when out deadline is, she wont be available.;28;8;moderately confident
6133a97236d89cffd20e5fa4;Being involved in a car accident; The author of the statement might have lied to increase the claimed amount of damage received to later get more money from their insurance;truthful;About half a year ago, I happened to be using the transport provided by work for staff as our family car had to undergo repairs. Ten minutes into the ride home on the highway, we heard loud popping sound, something resembling a gunshot, and before we knew what was happening, the car we were in veered off its lane and drove across the next lane and into the bushes on the side of the highway. As you can imagine, while all this was happening we were screaming in terror and making desperate efforts to somehow exit the vehicle, all in vain of course. When the car finally came to a standstill, we noticed that one of our male colleagues had been thrown out of the car through the windscreen, and now lay just in front of our stationery vehicle with blood trickling from his nose, ears and mouth. We all saw this when we exited the vehicle and a wave of utter silence washed over everyone present as we stared at the motionless body of our colleague in complete disbelief. Everybody else, including myself, was experiencing minor body pains and no serious injuries were evident. What followed after that was just a blur to me as I was quite traumatized at what had just happened. Shortly after the accident, paramedics, policemen and a lot of other people arrived and we were taken to the hospital for examinations, and this is where we learned that our poor colleague had unfortunately not survived that horrible accident. It has been 6 months since this happened but I still think of it quite often. We were later informed that it was due to one of the rear tyres bursting, and I cannot help but blame whoever's responsibility it was to ensure that the car was in perfect order before driving out. Very sad indeed.;28;8;moderately confident

I sat down and called one of my colleagues to tell them I was not feeling well and I was having pains in my abdomen.

I decided to have the surgery primarily to repair separated abdominal muscles following multiple pregnancies but also to boost my self-confidence. Although I was calm and collected during the approaching weeks of the surgery, the morning of the procedure I was extremely nervous. I felt selfish for undergoing elective surgery due to the impact of my lengthy recovery on my young family. The hospital team made me feel at ease and I was in the operating room within 90 minutes of my arrival at the hospital. The surgery was undertaken at a private hospital so the care and service I received was outstanding and could not be faulted. I felt well looked after throughout the whole experience. The procedure took approximately four and a half hours and went without complication. I did not experience nausea or any other issues related to general anaesthesia and was taken to my room soon after waking up. The worst part of the experience was being nil-by-mouth prior to surgery. Due to past medical complications involving post-surgical blood clots the team wanted me to mobilise soon after surgery, so within a few hours I was out of bed. I had done plenty of research prior  to surgery as to what to expect immediately following surgery and during the recovery period but experiencing it myself was different entirely despite my preparation. I was not prepared for exactly how painful it would be. Getting up and down and moving by myself was difficult. The experience was memorable for me because I had waited a very long  time to have the procedure and spent a long time saving money for it, and I was relieved to finally have it done.;34;9;confident

I have had chronic period pains for some time so I wanted to make sure everything was okay in terms of physical health. I went to a gynecologist and she had a look with an ultrasound. She did not make me feel like something huge was going on but adviced me to see another doctor to make sure she said all the right things. A day after that, I went to that other doctor, it all ended in bad news. I was told I had tumor on both my ovaries and they need to remove both of them but that was not it. It may have reached my uterus as he said. I seeked advice from many other doctors but it all sounded the same. I had the surgery after deciding on the best doctor to operate the surgery. The operation lasted for about 8 hours. I was in intensive care for a day afterwards. It was so hard to get up and walk after the surgery during my time in the hospital. My other organs were removed as well. I was in deep shock, it felt as if I was given a second chance in life, a whole new me. That was not all, I had intestinal complications post-surgery. My parents helped me get up and walk. It was difficult since I had kilos of oedema resulting from the operation. I wish it ended there, but I took 6 doses of chemotherapy afterwards which were the hardest times of my life. I had to fight against all the side effects and maintain a stable mentality.

I really like Sam but my employees found he was quite often lazy and forgetful. So in turn his hours was reduced and majority of his jobs where given to me. This included but was not limited to, pay. I had to document the data of any commission received and paid out. Not only did I have to do any new amounts that came in, I had to back track and review all previous data in order to make sure all the pots were correct. There was multiple mistakes not only on what Sam had done but with the sheet my boss had created in which I was referencing, this meant each weeks pots were incorrect. Not for all the advisers but definitely most. It was difficult for those with had written a lot of business. I didn't receive much support throughout and when I did it was often delayed. All the while my work load is increasing each month, with taking on new broker & advisers. The dead line was approaching quicker and quicker and I simply didn't make it. It's memorable to me because I don't think I ever finish properly. No one had the time to thoroughly check my work.;37;9;confident

I was quite nervous as I'd never had surgery under GA before. However, I wasn't too worried and was just really relieved that the cancerous growth had been found early before it had time to spread, and I wanted it removed asap. The surgeon takes it out with wide margins to avoid any spreading so its quite a big portion of tissue that is removed compared to normal skin lesion removal. The operation went very well, and afterwards it was quite tender and sore at the wound site. However, within a couple of days I had almost forgotten about it. I attended a follow-up appointment with the plastic surgeon and he was delighted with the healing taking place.

I still remember the immediate reaction I had the moment I felt the crash: I wasn't scared, I was just angry and started cursing.

After contacting the police and my parents, I stood waiting for them to arrive while the person who caused the accident (foreigner on vacation) contacted her friend or carer or whatever. The police officer asked me some questions for a bit, and then we went to the insurance company, where the representative told me that they couldn't do anything because they don't deal with foreign insurance companies, such as the one used by the woman who crashed into my family's car. 

Eventually we managed to get at least some financial settlement, but due to the age of our car we didn't get enough compensation to even begin to cover repairs or to purchase a brand new car. The worst part of it all is that now my family has another heavy monthly expense to deal with, and it has been part of the reason why my family has been struggling with money for a while.

I was given as leave from my company and allowed to work fully remote, we work hybrid but was told to stay at home. Only after 21 days was I told that medical leave would be considered if I didn't return as the owner f the company and I are very close.

At first I didn't take them seriously because I thought they were due to work stress. Then what followed was something I didn't expect, every morning I would wake up with my eyes swollen and the headaches got even worst. Soon after that I started to lose my vision, that is when I realized I needed to consult a doctor. I went to see a private a doctor but they couldn't see what the problem was. So I was given a letter to go the hospital. At the hospital they found that I had an optic tumor on my nerves and I have to undergo surgery to remove it.

661fcba2a52176d3a7bdddce;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;The author of the statement might have lied to exaggerate some side effects to receive extra compensation from their health insurance.;truthful;I had a kidney operation about 23 months ago. I moved residence a month or so before and did not have anybody to help me. Both my children was in another city and I suppose I did not want to be a nuisance so I did not want to ask for help from people I barely knew. The hospital was a two hour drive from where I was living, in Mossel bay. This is the reason why I remember it so well because I had to drive myself to the hospital. The day before the operation I prepared by doing some food and snack shopping and I made sure that I had all the water I would need so that I would not be left in need without help. I left at 4am in the morning and admitted myself. The hospital staff was not very nice during my stay there (they were not very empathetic) and the operation itself was very painful. It hurt a lot and I was very nauseated because of the anesthesia.  At least the Doctor was nice. When he was busy with the release forms he realised that I was supposed to drive back home by myself and he then kept me in hospital another day to give my some extra time to rest and recover. The drive home the next day was very unpleasant and I recall stopping at each town along the way for a 20 min rest.  I was fortunate that there was really amazing rest stops at 3 of the towns that I passed, so I was able to get out, use the bathroom and take a powernap in the back of my car. That evening at home I ended up having a bout of renal colic because of me over exerting myself. I would rather give birth again than experience renal colic.;49;10;very confident

I was walking towards the kitchen to prepare breakfast for my husband. I felt dizzy and fainted. My husband had to rush me to the hospital. I just found myself laying in the hospital bed being surrounded by doctors and nurses. the doctor had to quickly do some tests because l was having some sharp pain in my abdomen.  I was then told that l had a ruptured appendix so they had to operate me. I got shocked hearing this. All the nurses were just calming me down because the news triggered high blood pressure so they had to deal with it for the operation to be successful. Finally all was back to normal and the operation was done and it was successful. It was a memorable day because l thought that was the end of my life.;49;10;very confident
6124d4a2a63ff6077f74fac0;Being hospitalised and undergoing surgery;The author of the statement might have lied to exaggerate some side effects to receive extra compensation from their health insurance.;truthful;I broke and shattered my knee in two place two days before we were set to go on holiday for three weeks end December - January. We have been planning this trip for months, as our business closes for three weeks during December and it is school holidays for the kids. Like most accidents, it was unplanned and somewhat of an unnatural occurrence. Our family (myself, my husband, 4-year-old and six-year-old) was playing inside our swimming pool when my husband and I was playing around, and he tripped me in the water, and I fell on what we think might have been a rock. As soon as it happened, I realised something was very wrong, but my husband thought that it was only a minor injury, perhaps that I tore a ligament or had a minor fracture. After exiting the water with the assistance of my husband and mother-in-law, I realised that I could not put any pressure on it. My fears increased when I realised that I was also unable to move my leg in any way or form and severe swelling and pain started. Due to our medical fund, we were only covered at certain hospitals, and had to travel half an hour from home to reach our closest ER for assistance, which was no easy task. Thus, I did not go to the hospital immediately, but only the following morning. We had to also ensure that the said hospital was a good choice and had reputable Doctors to assist us with the matter at hand. Upon arrival at the ER the following morning, I was then examined and went for X-rays and then a CT scan where after the Orthopaedic surgeon came in to give me the bad news. I was booked for emergency trauma surgery the following morning. Not only did I have to prep myself for a second major surgery within 9 months, but our family would also not be able to go on our long-awaited vacation that we were so looking forward too. None the less, the surgery was successful but a long, painful and traumatic recovery lied ahead, and after 5 months I am still recovering physically and mentally from this experience. It is memorable, as it is now a little bit of an inside joke between myself and my husband, and the fact that I am still in recovery.;50;10;very confident

After a while again the cars tyre had issues…it got fixed and we set out again..I tried to sleep and the next thing I realized was the car swaying and the driver struggling to get a hold of the steering and in the short time between when the noise from my Mum woke me and the sight of the driver swaying the car somersaulted..it was really sad thankfully nothing else happened and we came out safe.

Since January, he had shortness of breath, tiredness and always sore ribs, until, one day, he was short of breath and couldn't even get up. We had to call an ambulance to take him with an oxygen mask to the hospital for pneumonia. He was hospitalized for 1 month with shortness of breath and tiredness and he underwent tests, scans and even surgery to remove fluid from the pleura.
 I was always worried about his health and his state of mind, which is still the case today because the after-effects are still present.

I eas very frightened by the situation because it could have caused a crash and a serious accident. What's more, we drove for over an hour without the help of that mirror, which was also quite dangerous and difficult given the weather conditions at the time. It was a stressful moment,
